#Development

##Week 1

I had some linking errors so I had trouble actually getitng it to work, but I understand the functionality
of the library. I have to do more to get it to install and link correctly, but the library does seem helpful.
It has the functionality for to create images using RGB values. More importantly, however, the library
allows me to load in my own images and save them which will be useful in order to create the user interface
for the player.

##Week 2

I ended up changing my project slightly. I still want to do a game, but instead of a platformer, I made it
into a space invader-like arcade game, which isn't too far different. I'm using ofImage and ofPixel to help
create the images in the game. So far, I've created the classes and wrote some helper functions in the
header files. Into the next week, my goal is to get some of the basic functions running and create the game
engine so that I can make it run and then get into the interface and human involvement in shooting and
dodging and whatnot.
