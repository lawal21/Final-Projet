I had some linking errors so I had trouble actually getitng it to work, but I understand the functionality
of the library. I have to do more to get it to install and link correctly, but the library does seem helpful.
It has the functionality for to create images using RGB values. More importantly, however, the library
allows me to load in my own images and save them which will be useful in order to create the user interface
for the player.
