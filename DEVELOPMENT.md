#Development

##Week 1

I had some linking errors so I had trouble actually getitng it to work, but I understand the functionality
of the library. I have to do more to get it to install and link correctly, but the library does seem helpful.
It has the functionality for to create images using RGB values. More importantly, however, the library
allows me to load in my own images and save them which will be useful in order to create the user interface
for the player.

##Week 2

I ended up changing my project slightly. I still want to do a game, but instead of a platformer, I made it
into a space invader-like arcade game, which isn't too far different. I'm using ofImage and ofPixel to help
create the images in the game. So far, I've created the classes and wrote some helper functions in the
header files. Into the next week, my goal is to get some of the basic functions running and create the game
engine so that I can make it run and then get into the interface and human involvement in shooting and
dodging and whatnot.

##Week 3

So far, I've set up all of my classes for the most part. I need to add more to bullets so that the image
moves by itself in the y-axis. I'm a little bit behind, having not gotten my program to run yet, but
my goal for the next couple of days is to get the monsters to move around the screen and the player to be 
able to move as well. After that, I will need to just get the shooting to work both the player and enemies,
as well as letting the bullets kill what they hit by removing the image. With any time left, I can extend
however I seem fit via animations, interface, and other game features. 

##Week 4

After a lot of tedious bug-fixing and learning how to work around with ofImage, I was able to get the
handle my classes and draw the game, considering for collisions. I extended the game in a few ways, such
as adding a point system, adding a start/pause/win/loss screen, adding player animation, and adding different
difficulties. The most difficult part of this was mostly just learning how to use ofImage and 
openFrameworks in general, but once I understood it, it was much easier to implement my code. It was really 
cool to be able to implement my own version of a childhood game that I used to play myself.
