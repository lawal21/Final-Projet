#Proposal

For this project, I will trying to make a platformer game with a character going through stages to get to 
the end of a level. Depending on time, I would like to add a simple boss fight at the end of the level. 
Another extension would beto have multiple levels. I really enjoy video games and I think being a game 
designer/devloper would be a really cool profession so I think doing this would be fun and good experience 
for myself. This may be a more challenging project for this timeframe, and I might scale down what type of 
game I want to create, but I will try to get this done. I will be using the FreeImage library which helps 
for image saving and loading. This will beuseful for loading images of the character, obstacles, background,
etc. I don't have any expeirence with platformers but I understand how they work so I don't think it will 
be too overwhelming.

##Amendment

I ended up changing from a platformer game to a space invader-like game with a player shooting the enemies
coming in from the sky. My reasoning why I chose this game is the same as previously, but this type of
game is easier to implement in the limited time frame given to us. Also, instead of using FreeImage, I
ended up using ofImage which is practically the same thing as the documentation of ofImage states that
"ofImage uses a library called "freeImage" under the hood."
