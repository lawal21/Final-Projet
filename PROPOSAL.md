#Proposal

For this project, I will trying to make a platformer game with a character going through stages to get to the end of a 
level. Depending on time, I would like to add a simple boss fight at the end of the level. Another extension would be
to have multiple levels. I really enjoy video games and I think being a game designer/devloper would be a really cool
profession so I think doing this would be fun and good experience for myself. This may be a more challenging project
for this timeframe, and I might scale down what type of game I want to create, but I will try to get this done. I will 
be using the FreeImage library which helps for image saving and loading. This will beuseful for loading images of the
character, obstacles, background, etc. I don't have any expeirence with platformers but I understand how they work
so I don't think it will be overwhelming.
