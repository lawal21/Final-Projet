# Final Project

This is an openFrameworks based application. An open source C++ toolkit that is downloadable from here
https://openframeworks.cc/download/. It is a video game based upon the popular arcade game, "Space
Invaders." All the images are included in the bin and there are no add-ons as the main library used is the
ofImage library, a library included in the openFrameworks download. The game is quite simple: the player
has to control his sprite to dodge the incoming invaders, while simultaneously shooting back in order to
kill of the enemy invaders. The game ends either when the player wins by killing all the invaders, or loses
when an enemy bullet (or if the game goes on longer enough, an invader) makes contact with the player.
